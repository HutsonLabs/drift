//! The capability sets Drift advertises (plan §1.4, §2 decision 8).
//!
//! Verified against g-r-d 50.2: `[V8_1{AVC420_ENABLED}, V8{}]` is confirmed as V8.1 and the
//! server sends AVC420 when it has a hardware encoder, RFX Progressive otherwise. Any V10.x set
//! would make it choose AVC444v2 (without `AVC_DISABLED`) or V10.7 + Progressive (with it), so
//! no V10 set is ever offered. The list is fixed; there is deliberately no way to change it.

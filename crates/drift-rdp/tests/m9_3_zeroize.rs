//! M9-3 Red: the one-time redirect credentials are zeroized, proven at the allocator.
//!
//! Plan §1.3: the Server Redirection PDU carries single-use credentials that must never be
//! persisted, and plan M9-3 requires them to be zeroized. `Zeroizing` fields make that true by
//! construction — but only for the copies someone remembered to wrap. A `Debug` assertion
//! cannot see the heap, so this test watches the **allocator**: while it is armed, every block
//! handed back to the system is scanned for a canary before it is freed.
//!
//! That is why this lives in its own test binary: a `#[global_allocator]` is process-wide.

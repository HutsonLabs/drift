//! Scroll accumulator producing fractional wheel units. Owned by task **M2-3**.
//!
//! g-r-d turns every wheel event into `value / 120 × 10 px` of smooth scrolling, fractional values
//! included (plan §1.5: 30 × +12 scrolls exactly as far as 3 × +120). So trackpad deltas are
//! converted to small wheel-unit events rather than whole notches.
//!
//! Sign conventions (RDP): vertical `+` = scroll up (towards the top of the document), horizontal
//! `+` = scroll right. AppKit's `scrollingDeltaX/Y` already include the user's *natural scrolling*
//! preference (`isDirectionInvertedFromDevice`), and a positive delta means "towards the top /
//! left", so vertical passes through and horizontal is negated. The HWHEEL sign as g-r-d applies it
//! is locked in by the `e2e_hscroll` test.
